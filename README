In-Class Assignment

Write a program in Java to implement a very large number ADT (BigNumber)

The BigNumber ADT has to implement the following restrictions: 

* Store a maximum of 64 digits
* Only non-negative numbers are allowed
* implement addition
* implement substraction
* implement Multiplication
* implement division and remainder / Modulo (Integer Operations)
* implement the Comparable (java) Interface
* validate the constructor (throw an exception)            InvalidBigNumberException
* validate the division by 0 (throw an exception)         ArithmeticException 
* validate the overflow (throw an exception)             BigNUmberOverflowException


Write a test class (Main) that: 

(tryes to) instantiate 7 BigNumber objects

    bn1 = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890;
    bn2 = 5678990567890567890567890567890567890567890567890;
    bn3 = 38473847874728740283748237408237428347128347082134700;
    bn4 = 42893740482574097583475382;
    bn5 = 0;
    bn6 = 3847384787472874028374823740823742834712834708213470038473847874728740283748237408237428347128347082134700; 
    bn7 = 82837589245u897;

    each one has to be enclosed in a try-catch block
    (the constructor receives a String)

and (tryes to) do the following operations :

    bn3 * bn1                         (overflow)

    bn2 + bn3                          (show the result)

    bn4 / bn5                          (catch the aritmetic exception)

    bn3 - bn1                         (show the result)

    bn1 - bn3                         (catch the exception)

    bn3 / bn4                         (show the result)

    bn3 % bn1                         (show the result)

    bn4 * bn4                         (show the result)
